# ProxyBase

> **Category:** Bandwidth Sharing | **Status:** Active
> **Website:** [https://proxybase.org](https://proxybase.org)

## Description

ProxyBase is a bandwidth-sharing platform that pays users in cryptocurrency for sharing their unused internet connection. You authenticate the peer client with an **Access Token** from your dashboard. Residential IPs earn the most, but datacenter IPs are also supported — they currently receive less traffic than residential. Official multi-arch Docker image (amd64/arm64/armv7).

## Earning Estimates

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Monthly range | $0 - $5 (estimate) |
| Per | device |
| Minimum payout | $1 |
| Payout frequency | On request |
| Payment methods | Crypto |

> Crypto payouts. Earnings depend on location and bandwidth usage.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Residential IP | No |
| VPS/Datacenter IP | Yes -- supported, but currently receives less traffic than residential |
| Minimum bandwidth | None |
| GPU required | No |
| Minimum storage | None |
| Supported platforms | Docker (amd64/arm64/armv7), Windows, Linux |

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create an account

Sign up at [ProxyBase](https://peer.proxybase.org?referral=nXzS3c6iTO). If the referral field is not pre-filled, enter referral code `nXzS3c6iTO` in the **Referral Code** box before creating your account.

### 2. Get your Access Token

After signing up and verifying your email, open your [dashboard](https://peer.proxybase.org/dashboard) and copy your **Access Token** — it is shown in the Docker command on the setup page and looks like a short alphanumeric string.

### 3. Deploy with CashPilot

In the CashPilot web UI, find **ProxyBase** in the service catalog and click **Deploy**. Enter your Access Token and a device name (no spaces), and CashPilot will handle the rest.

> **Upgrading from an older CashPilot?** ProxyBase moved to a new client image and replaced its credentials: the old `USER_ID`/`DEVICE_NAME` values are retired and cannot be reused. Generate a fresh **Access Token** in your [dashboard](https://peer.proxybase.org/dashboard), then re-deploy ProxyBase from the catalog with it (plus a Device Name) — existing containers built on the old image have stopped earning.

## Docker Configuration

- **Image:** `ghcr.io/proxybaseorg/peer-cli@sha256:b78dda3969019eb9e0d3ba0aeba0929148337898b00d99cf780f4d8c99b31b0e` (digest-pinned; the catalog entry is authoritative if they ever differ)
- **Platforms:** linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/arm/v7

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Label | Required | Secret | Description |
|----------|-------|:--------:|:------:|-------------|
| `ID` | Access Token | Yes | Yes | Your ProxyBase Access Token from the dashboard |
| `NAME` | Device Name | Yes | No | Any name to identify this device in your ProxyBase dashboard (default: `cashpilot-{hostname}`) |

## Troubleshooting

### ProxyBase shows "running" but earnings stopped (or dropped to $0)

If ProxyBase was deployed before the migration to the new client, the container is still running ProxyBase's **retired** image — it looks healthy in the dashboard but no longer earns, because the old backend was shut down. The dashboard cannot tell the retired client from the current one.

Fix: **Remove** the ProxyBase service, then **Deploy** it again from the catalog and paste a fresh **Access Token** from [your dashboard](https://peer.proxybase.org/dashboard). The redeploy pulls the current `ghcr.io/proxybaseorg/peer-cli` image.

### Container loops on `Missing ID and NAME`

The peer client accepts its credentials **only as command-line arguments**. Its error text also offers "environment variables ID and NAME", but no published image actually reads them — a container started with only the environment variables loops on `Missing ID and NAME` forever while showing as "running".

CashPilot releases from 2026-07-17 through 1.35.x deployed exactly that shape, so **every fresh ProxyBase deploy in that window hit this** (issue #343). Current CashPilot passes the token and device name as arguments. Fix: upgrade CashPilot, then **Deploy** ProxyBase again from the catalog. If you used an exported compose file from an affected release, re-export it — old exports carried literal `${ID}` placeholders in the command.
