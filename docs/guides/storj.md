# Storj

> **Category:** Storage Sharing | **Status:** Active

## Description

Storj is a decentralized cloud storage network where you earn by renting out your unused disk space. Run the storage node via Docker and get paid approximately $1.50/TB stored per month plus $2/TB egress. Payments are in STORJ token or via zkSync L2. Requires at least 550GB of available disk space and a stable internet connection. One of the most mature and truly passive storage income services.

## Earning Estimates

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Monthly range | $0 - $15 (estimate) |
| Per | TB |
| Minimum payout | $4 |
| Payout frequency | Monthly |
| Payment methods | Crypto |

> ~$1.50/TB stored + $2/TB egress + $2.74/TB audit/repair. Earnings scale with disk allocated and node age. First 9 months have held-back escrow. Port 28967 (TCP+UDP) must be forwarded.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Residential IP | No |
| Minimum bandwidth | 5 Mbps upload |
| GPU required | No |
| Minimum storage | 550GB |
| Supported platforms | Docker, Windows, Linux |

## Setup Instructions

### 1. No account needed

Storj storage nodes are **permissionless** — no signup, no account, no auth token. You just run the software. The old authorization token requirement was removed in mid-2025.

Documentation has moved to [storj.dev/node](https://storj.dev/node/get-started/setup).

### 2. Create a node identity

Before running a storage node, you must generate a cryptographic identity. This involves computing a proof-of-work to difficulty 36, which takes **several hours** of CPU time.

```bash
# Download the identity binary
curl -L https://github.com/storj/storj/releases/latest/download/identity_linux_amd64.zip -o identity.zip
unzip identity.zip

# Generate identity (CPU-intensive, takes hours)
nohup ./identity create storagenode --identity-dir /path/to/identity/ > /tmp/storj-identity.log 2>&1 &
```

The process outputs progress like `Generated 50000 keys; best difficulty so far: 34`. It's done when it reaches difficulty 36 and exits. Files created: `ca.cert`, `ca.key`, `identity.cert`, `identity.key`.

### 3. Port forwarding

Forward these ports through your router to the server running the node:
- **TCP+UDP 28967** — Storage node traffic (required, UDP for QUIC)
- **TCP 14002** — Dashboard/monitoring (optional, local access only)

### 4. Get an ERC-20 wallet address

You need an Ethereum-compatible wallet address to receive STORJ token payouts. Any ERC-20 wallet works (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger, etc.). If you already have an Ethereum address from other DePIN services, you can reuse it. Storj also supports zkSync L2 payouts (same address, lower gas fees).

### 5. Deploy with CashPilot

In the CashPilot web UI, find **Storj** in the service catalog and click **Deploy**. You'll be asked for:
- **Wallet address** — your ERC-20 wallet for payouts
- **Email** — for operator notifications
- **External address** — a DDNS hostname with port (e.g. `mynode.ddns.net:28967`). A literal public IP works until your ISP silently re-provisions it — from that day satellites dial a dead address and count the node offline while everything looks healthy locally
- **Storage allocation** — how much disk space to offer (e.g. `2TB`)
- **Identity path** — host directory where your identity files are stored
- **Storage path** — host directory on a spinning disk (HDD) for storing data

CashPilot will handle the container creation with proper volume mounts.

## Docker Configuration

- **Image:** `storj/storagenode`
- **Platforms:** linux/amd64, linux/arm64

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Label | Required | Secret | Description |
|----------|-------|:--------:|:------:|-------------|
| `WALLET` | Wallet address | Yes | No | ERC-20 wallet address for STORJ token payouts (or zkSync) |
| `EMAIL` | Email | Yes | No | Email address for operator notifications |
| `ADDRESS` | External address | Yes | No | DDNS hostname with port (e.g. mynode.ddns.net:28967) — prefer over a literal IP |
| `STORAGE` | Storage allocation | Yes | No | Maximum disk space to allocate (e.g. 2TB) (default: `1TB`) |
| `IDENTITY_DIR` | Identity directory | Yes | No | Host path where identity files are stored (ca.cert, identity.cert, etc.) |
| `STORAGE_DIR` | Storage directory | Yes | No | Host path on a spinning disk (HDD) for Storj data storage |

### Important Notes

- **Use a DDNS hostname for `ADDRESS`, never a literal IP.** Satellites dial your node back at exactly the address it advertises. Residential ISPs re-provision public IPs without notice, and when that happens a node advertising the old literal IP is counted offline around the clock — container healthy, dashboard green, earnings from new data at zero — until someone notices the provider's offline emails. A dynamic-DNS hostname (DuckDNS, Cloudflare DDNS, your router's DDNS client) self-heals through an IP change. If satellites cannot reach the node, CashPilot's producer state for Storj reports it with the exact reason; you can also check yourself with `curl -s http://<server>:14002/api/sno/` (`lastPinged` stale or `quicStatus: "Misconfigured"` means unreachable).
- **No signup required**: Storj nodes are permissionless since mid-2025. No auth token, no account creation.
- **Escrow period**: First 9 months of operation have held-back escrow (75% of storage fees held, released gradually). This incentivizes long-term operation.
- **One node per public IP**: Storj recommends one node per public IP for optimal satellite allocation. Nodes on the same /24 subnet share data allocation.
- **Uptime matters**: Nodes with poor uptime get less data. Aim for 99.5%+ uptime.
- **Disk selection**: Always use spinning disks (HDD). Storj data is cold storage — IOPS don't matter, capacity does. SSDs offer no advantage and cost more per TB.
- **QUIC**: UDP port 28967 enables the QUIC protocol for faster transfers. Forward both TCP and UDP.
