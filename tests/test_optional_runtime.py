"""Optional container runtime passthrough (CashPilot-54q).

The research verdict this implements is a REFUSAL: do not adopt gVisor as a
default or as a supported "hardened profile". The escape path it defends is
already closed by the deploy-spec validation (privileged refused, capabilities
and network_mode allowlisted, host bind mounts blocked), and there is no
documented case of a mainstream proxyware image escaping its container. The
risks that actually occur here are IP attribution and lateral movement, which
gVisor does not address — while costing roughly 1.7x network throughput on a
workload that is pure network I/O.

So what ships is the cheap concession: an advanced user who has already
installed a runtime can opt one service into it and own the outcome. Nothing
defaults to it, and nothing recommends it.
