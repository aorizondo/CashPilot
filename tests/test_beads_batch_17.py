"""CashPilot-c50: a dollar balance compared against a token minimum at 1:1.

The balance is recorded in whatever the collector reports; the payout minimum
is declared in whatever the provider cashes out in. For thirteen of the fifteen
registered collectors those agree, which is why nothing noticed. Two disagree:

* Storj — the collector reports USD (its API gives cents), the catalog declares
  ``currency: STORJ, min_amount: 4.0``;
* anyone-protocol — USD against ANYONE.

So a real $3.50 balance rendered as "Balance now: 3.50 STORJ", the card said
"0.50 to go" toward a threshold in a different unit, and the service-row
tooltip printed 4 STORJ as "$4.00". Every number the user was asked to compare
was in a unit it was not in.

Fixed by reconciling once, in payouts.min_payout_in, and using it everywhere the
two are compared: eligibility, the projection, the progress card, the service
row, the claim modal, and the "closest to payout" sort.
