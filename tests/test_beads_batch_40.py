"""CashPilot-zdi: a container nobody could measure reported 0.00% CPU.

``_collect_stats`` returned ``(0.0, 0.0, None, None)`` when the Docker stats
call failed. The network counters were None because a failed read is not
evidence of no traffic — the docstring right above says so — and exactly the
same argument applies to CPU and memory, which were reporting a confident
0.00% / 0.0 MB for a container that may be working hard.

One ``return`` statement, two kinds of unknown, reported two different ways.

Fixing the source meant fixing every consumer, because ``.get(key, 0)`` does not
help when the key EXISTS with value None:

* the per-service aggregate summed it as zero, dragging the average down;
* /metrics published a flat zero line instead of a gap;
* the running-costs estimate billed it as an idle container;
* the dashboard rendered ``|| '0'`` as ``0%``.
