"""Batch 3: a shape change must not be recorded as a real reading.

Three collectors turned a renamed or missing provider field into a confident
0.00 and wrote it to the earnings table with no error. That number then flowed
everywhere a real balance flows — and for Storj it was a DROP from the previous
reading, so the payout detector asked the user to confirm receiving money that
was never paid. A confirmed payout is permanent.

Plus the migration that bricked startup on an upgraded volume, and two access
gates that disagreed with their own server.
