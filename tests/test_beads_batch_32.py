"""CashPilot-de1: CI and local development tested different code.

``pyproject.toml`` + ``uv.lock`` are the source of truth, and the Dockerfile
installs with ``uv sync --frozen`` — so what SHIPS is pinned. But the test
workflow installed from ``requirements.txt``, which listed unpinned lower bounds
(``fastapi>=0.136.1``, ...), and then pip-installed pytest and friends by hand
on top.

The consequence is not theoretical. Local development sat on fastapi 0.136.1 /
starlette 1.0.1; CI resolved 0.141.1 / 1.3.1. On the newer pair
``include_router`` stops adding its routes to ``app.routes``, so a route sweep
silently covered 65 of 76 — a real behaviour difference that appeared only on
CI, and only because one test happened to assert something that noticed.

A green local suite was not evidence about what CI would do, nor about what a
user installing today would get.

Now every workflow that runs the suite resolves from the same lockfile the image
ships, and there is no second list at all.

The export outlived its usefulness and then did damage. requirements.txt was
kept as a pinned copy of the lock, but nothing installed from it: not the image
(`uv sync --frozen`), not CI, not the dependency graph. Dependabot's `pip`
ecosystem found it, though, and #350 bumped six pins in it — a change that
could not reach a built image, left uv.lock behind, and asked for
pydantic-core 2.48.0 next to pydantic 2.13.4, which pins pydantic-core==2.46.4
exactly. pip answers that pair with ResolutionImpossible, so the one instruction
that used the file could no longer be followed.

One lockfile, one resolution, and the bot points at it.
