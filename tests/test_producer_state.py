"""Producer state is not container health (CashPilot-b4e).

Container health is computed from restarts and crashes, so a service that has
produced nothing for a month still scores 100/100. "It runs but earns nothing"
is the most common complaint in this category and container health cannot see it.

The tests that matter most are the ones about NOT claiming to know: a service
with no collector must read unknown rather than idle, because saying "idle" when
we simply cannot see the earnings is the false confidence this exists to remove.
