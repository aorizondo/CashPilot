"""CashPilot-364: the one failure nothing else can surface reached nobody.

A container is up, its collector authenticates fine, and the balance has not
moved for days. That is exactly what ``_flatline_check`` was built for — its own
docstring says "Every other view of the system looks healthy, so nothing else
would surface it".

It wrote the alert to SQLite and handed it to ``notify.send``, and then the row
was silently dropped on the way to the UI. ``_flatline_check`` never appended to
``_collector_alerts``, and ``_run_collection`` assigned that list *before*
calling it. ``_warm_collector_alerts`` filtered on ``kind in ("collector",
"payout")``, so a restart dropped it too.

On a default install ``notify`` is the only other route and it is not
configured: ``configured_targets()`` returns [] and ``send`` returns 0
immediately, and neither docker-compose.yml nor docker-compose.fleet.yml sets
any NTFY/WEBHOOK/TELEGRAM variable. So the bell said "All collectors healthy"
while a service earned nothing.
