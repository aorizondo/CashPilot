"""Pre-deploy reality check (CashPilot-w58).

The catalog shows one generic earnings range per service, so a user cannot tell
before deploying whether it will work in *their* situation — and several will
not. They find out weeks later, when it has earned nothing.

Two properties matter more than the individual verdicts, and both are tested
below: it never blocks a deploy (informed consent, not a nanny), and it never
implies a check that was not run.
