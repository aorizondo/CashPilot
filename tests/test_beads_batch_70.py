"""CashPilot-luj, tier 1: where does my money actually go?

A user could not answer the most basic financial question about their own
installation. Payout destinations existed only inside container env vars and
config files, scattered across every worker, with no screen listing them.

This is the CATALOG foundation: every service declares its payout MODEL, and
where applicable the address and how it is set. The catalog stays the source of
truth, so adding a service is one YAML block rather than an edit to a route.

THE DESIGN DECISION THAT SHAPES EVERYTHING: the model is a first-class field, not
an address that happens to be empty. Three real payout mechanisms exist and they
are not variations of one thing —

  * external: the user supplies an address they own. There IS one to show.
  * internal: the service holds an off-chain balance and pays out on request.
    There is NO address, and a blank field would read as "you forgot to
    configure this" when nothing is configurable.
  * minted:   the container generates its own wallet and accrues to it. The user
    has typically never seen it.

and a fourth value that is deliberate rather than a placeholder:

  * unknown:  not yet determined. The acceptance criteria ask for this
    explicitly — "visibly flagged, not silently blank".

STRICTLY NO PRIVATE KEYS. This tier is a registry of public addresses and payout
mechanics. That is why it comes first: most of the answer, zero custody risk.
