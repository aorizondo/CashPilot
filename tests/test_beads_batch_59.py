"""The server turned "the phone could not tell" into "stopped".

``app/main.py`` built each Android app's row with::

    "status": "running" if a.get("running") else "stopped"

The Android client now sends ``running: null`` when it cannot determine the
answer — every one of its detection signals degrades to ``false`` when
notification and usage access are denied, so it used to report *every* earning
app as stopped. That was fixed on the phone (CashPilot-android-1oo); this is the
other half, because a falsy ``None`` landed in the same ``else`` branch here and
the fleet page inherited the identical false claim.

The distinction is not cosmetic. **Stopped** means the service should be
reporting and is not — restart it. **Unknown** means the worker could not see —
grant the permission. Collapsing them sends a user to fix the wrong thing.
