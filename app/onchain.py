"""Read-only on-chain balances (CashPilot-dv6, tier 2).

Once tier 1 knows WHERE a service pays, this reads what actually arrived. It
handles no private key, constructs no transaction and signs nothing — the only
operation is "what is the balance at this public address?".

THE RULE THIS MODULE EXISTS TO ENFORCE, and it is the same rule as everywhere
else in this codebase: **absent is not zero**. A chain we could not reach must
never render as a balance of 0. Zero is a fact about an address; unreachable is
a fact about us. Showing the second as the first tells a user their money is
gone when the truth is that a public RPC rate-limited us.

So every read returns a STATE, never a bare number:

    known          we asked and got an answer. ``amount`` is real, 0 included.
    unreachable    the RPC failed, timed out, or answered nonsense.
    unsupported    we have no endpoint for that chain.
    invalid        the address is not well formed for that chain, so we did
                   not ask at all. Never send a malformed address to a public
                   endpoint just to see what happens.

Public RPCs are a courtesy, not an entitlement. Results are cached and a failing
endpoint is backed off, because a dashboard that polls hard gets blocked — and a
blocked endpoint degrades every user of this feature, not just the impatient one.

No API keys. Every endpoint here is keyless by choice; a chain that needs a key
stays ``unsupported`` until the user supplies one, and a shared key is never
shipped.
