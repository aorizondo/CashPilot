"""Is this MACHINE worth keeping powered on? (CashPilot-l01)

The question people ask is "does this service make money", and for a shared box
that question has no honest answer. Adding a bandwidth container to a machine
that is already on costs roughly 1-3 W — about EUR 0.19 a month at EUR
0.105/kWh — which is **below the measurement error of a consumer smart plug**.
A per-service "net profit" figure there would be fabricated precision: it would
look authoritative and be noise.

The question that does have an answer is about the machine. A dedicated ~65 W
node at EUR 0.20/kWh costs about EUR 9.50 a month against a typical USD 3-6
gross from a single node. That is net negative, it is knowable, and nobody is
currently told.

So this module answers per-MACHINE and refuses to answer per-service on a shared
host. That refusal is the feature, not a limitation of it.

Three rules:

* **Refuse fabricated precision.** Below the resolution of the cheapest thing
  that could check the number, there is no number — only a shrug with a decimal
  point on it.
* **Estimates are labelled estimates.** Everything here rests on a user-entered
  wattage and tariff. Both are guesses, the output inherits that, and it says so.
* **Never act on it.** No auto-stop, no throttling, no "helpful" suggestion the
  code carries out. Show the number and let the operator decide; the electricity
  is theirs and so is the call.
