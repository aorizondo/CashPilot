"""Lateral containment, and owning the attribution risk (CashPilot-q0o).

The documented danger of running proxyware is not container escape. It is that
someone else's traffic exits YOUR address and is attributed to you — the FBI/IC3
has issued a public notice about residential proxy networks, and researchers
have shown operators cannot see what traffic leaves their own exit node. The
second realistic risk is a hostile image scanning the home LAN it was handed:
Home Assistant, NAS shares, a media server, a password manager.

The first risk cannot be engineered away here. Selling that egress IS the
product, so any control that blocked it would block the thing the user installed
CashPilot to do. What can be reduced is LATERAL reach: a bandwidth container has
no business talking to a NAS.

Two decisions shape this module.

**It states the attribution risk plainly, at deploy time.** Not in an FAQ, not
in a tooltip. A self-hosting audience is persuaded by a project that owns the
downside; burying it is what makes people distrust the whole category.

**It does not silently reconfigure the host's network.** Creating bridges and
firewall rules on someone's machine is a change with real blast radius, and
several services would break in ways that cost money: Storj needs an inbound
port and its own dashboard reachable for the collector, and Mysterium runs on
the host network where no bridge applies at all. So this computes what CAN be
isolated, names every exception and why, and leaves the act to the operator.
