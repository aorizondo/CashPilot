"""Pre-deploy reality check (CashPilot-w58).

The catalog shows one generic earnings range per service. A user cannot tell,
before deploying, whether a service will work at all *in their situation* — and
several will not. They find out weeks later, when it has earned nothing.

This turns what we already know into a decision the user can actually make:
a verdict and one or two plain sentences, not a wall of warnings.

Two rules shape everything here:

* **Informed consent, not a nanny.** Where the answer is "this will earn nothing
  for you", say so plainly and let them deploy anyway. Nothing here blocks.
* **Never imply a check we did not run.** We cannot currently detect egress IP
  type or connection speed (that is CashPilot-5qc). Requirements that depend on
  those are reported as *unverified preconditions in the user's own words*,
  never as a pass. Claiming a green light we did not earn is worse than silence.
