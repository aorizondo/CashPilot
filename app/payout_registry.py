"""Where the money goes: the payout registry (CashPilot-luj, tier 1).

Distinct from ``app/payouts.py``, which is about payout *events* — detecting that
a balance dropped, and projecting when the next threshold is reached. This module
is about payout *destinations*: which address does each service actually pay to.

The catalog declares each service's payout MODEL; the deployed spec holds the
address the container was really given. Joining the two lets a user answer "which
addresses do my services pay to?" from one screen instead of reading env vars on
every worker.

THE RULE THIS MODULE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: an address is shown only when it is
KNOWN, and four states are genuinely different. Collapsing them is how a registry
starts lying.

* ``external`` with a resolved address — show it.
* ``external`` with nothing resolved — **"not set", and that is ACTIONABLE**: the
  service may be earning into nowhere.
* ``internal`` — there is NO address, by design. A blank here would read as "you
  forgot to configure this" when nothing is configurable.
* ``unknown`` — we have not classified this service. Say so; do not imply the
  user got something wrong.

STRICTLY NO PRIVATE KEYS. This reads a public address out of a spec the server
already stores, and nothing else. It never touches a key, a seed or a keystore —
which is precisely why it can ship ahead of the on-chain tiers.
