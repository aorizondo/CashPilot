"""Encrypted export of irreplaceable service state (CashPilot-qqo).

Users overwhelmingly do not back up node identities and wallets, because nothing
tells them those files exist. When a disk dies the held payout balance, the relay
stake, or the wallet is simply gone — and no other feature in this project
survives that.

It is also the most dangerous thing here, because it hands the worker a new
capability: reading key material out of a container volume. The worker already
holds the Docker socket, so the question is not whether it *could* but whether
the design ever gives anyone a reason to.

The constraints below are not tunable knobs. Each one closes a specific way this
feature turns into an exfiltration channel.

**The installation must not be able to decrypt its own exports.** No server-held
wrapping key, no fallback to the Fernet key that protects credentials. If
CashPilot could open the bundle, then anyone who compromises CashPilot inherits
every node identity it ever exported — turning a backup feature into the single
highest-value target in the system. So the user supplies the target: either an
X25519 recipient public key, where no secret ever enters CashPilot at all, or a
passphrase which is used and discarded.

**No destination but the response to the authenticated caller.** No upload, no
sync, no webhook. The moment such a path exists in the code, a compromised UI
can switch it on; the absence of the code is the control.

**No scheduled export.** A timer needs a stored secret, which is precisely the
server-held key the first rule forbids. Alert on "no verified backup" instead.

**AEAD, not encryption alone.** ChaCha20-Poly1305 so tampering is detected
rather than decrypted into garbage, with the header authenticated as associated
data so nobody can swap the metadata that says which service a bundle belongs to.

And the part users get wrong: **losing the passphrase means the backup is gone.**
There is no recovery, by construction. Anything that could recover it would
violate the first rule.
