"""Shared FastAPI dependencies and template environment for CashPilot.

These auth guards and the Jinja2 template environment are imported into
``app.main`` (via ``from app.deps import *``) so that ``app.main._require_owner``
et al. keep resolving for tests that patch/import them through ``app.main``.
Route handlers split into ``app.routers.*`` reference these through the
``app.main`` namespace so existing ``patch("app.main.auth.*")`` /
``patch("app.main.database.*")`` test seams keep landing.
